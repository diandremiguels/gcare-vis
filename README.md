# G-Care Vis

This project is a visualization tool for the [G-Care](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3318464.3389702) benchmark.

In the interface, users can select files to visualize them, then they can highlight the correspondence between text and graph components, as well as edit and create their own graphs.

To run the code, first download the [datasets](https://github.com/yspark-dblab/gcare) and store them in `fileprocessor/static/queries`.

Then, from the root folder, run `python manage.py runserver` to test the project in localhost.
