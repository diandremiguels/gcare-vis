# G-Care Vis

This project is a visualization tool for the [G-Care](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3318464.3389702) benchmark.

In the interface, users can select files to visualize them, then they can highlight the correspondence between text and graph components, as well as edit and create their own graphs.

Run `python manage.py runserver` to test the project in localhost.
